# Alloy

Alloy implements high-performance, well-tested & documented libraries for interacting with Ethereum and other EVM-based chains.

We provide:
* [`core`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/core): Core types for Rust Ethereum, RPC types for JSON-RPC, RLP encoding/decoding, a compile-time/run-time ABI encoder/decoder, and a representation of Solidity's type system in Rust for usage in procedural macros and more.
* [`svm-rs`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/svm-rs): Solidity-Compiler Version Manager, in Rust, for usage as a tool and as a library.
* (Soon) [`alloy`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy): Rust interface to Ethereum and other EVM-based chains. -->
* (Soon) [`middleware`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/middleware): Alloy Middleware for overriding default interactions with a chain.
* (Soon) [`chains`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/chains): Canonical type definitions for EVM-based chains.
