Alloy implements high-performance, well-tested & documented libraries for interacting with Ethereum and other EVM-based chains.

We provide:
* [`alloy`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy): Transports, Middleware, and Networks for the Alloy project.
* [`core`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/core): Core types for Rust Ethereum, RPC types for JSON-RPC, RLP encoding/decoding, a compile-time/run-time ABI encoder/decoder, and a representation of Solidity's type system in Rust for usage in procedural macros and more.
* [`trie`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/trie): Fast Merkle-Patricia Trie (MPT) state root calculator and proof generator for prefix-sorted nibbles.
* [`nybbles`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/nybbles): Efficient nibble-sized (4-bit) byte sequence data structure.
* [`chains`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/chains): Canonical type definitions for EVM-based chains.
* [`svm-rs`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/svm-rs): Solidity-Compiler Version Manager, in Rust, for usage as a tool and as a library.
* [`rlp`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/rlp): Fast implementation of Ethereum RLP serialization.

We also have:
* [`book`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/book): A book on all things Alloy.
* [`examples`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/examples): Example code for using `alloy` and `alloy-core`.
